The `cty_industry` files were provided by David Dorn via email to Andrew Foote. We believe he created the files using these imputation files on his website:

https://www.ddorn.net/data/cbp1990_imputations.zip
https://www.ddorn.net/data/cbp2000_imputations.zip

However, we do not have the code that created these files.
