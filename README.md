The repository has the following structure:

- [raw](raw/): Location for raw (unprocessed) datasets. We do not provide the data, but provide the download locations. The datasize may be substantial.
- [data](data/): Location for transformed datasets. Some of the transformations may have been manual, and are documented in the [README](data/README.md) in that directory
- [programs](programs/): Programs to read in raw data, process the data, and create the analysis are here. Programs may be in SAS or Stata.
- [replication](replication/): as part of the paper, we replicate Autor, Dorn, Hanson (2013). The code to do that is in this directory.
- [paper](paper/): original LaTeX paper locations

The relevant Paper is on Overleaf and in a separate Github repo.
