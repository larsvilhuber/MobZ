  abstract = {We analyze the effect of rising Chinese import competition between 1990 and 2007 on US local labor markets, exploiting cross- market variation in import exposure stemming from initial differences in industry specialization and instrumenting for US imports using changes in Chinese imports by other high-income countries. Rising imports cause higher unemployment, lower labor force participation, and reduced wages in local labor markets that house import-competing manufacturing industries. In our main specification, import competition explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in US manufacturing employment. Transfer benefits payments for unemployment, disability, retirement, and healthcare also rise sharply in more trade-exposed labor markets.},

We hypothesize that polarization stems from the interaction between consumer preferences, which favor variety over specialization, and the falling cost of automating routine, codifiable job tasks. Applying a spatial equilibrium model, we corroborate four implications of this hypothesis. Local labor markets that specialized in routine tasks differentially adopted information technology, reallocated low-skill labor into service occupations (employment polarization), experienced earnings growth at the tails of the distribution (wage polarization), and received inflows of skilled labor.},

Summary tables from decennial censuses and the American Community Survey include county and state tables since 1790; census tract tables since 1910; and tables for all original census summary levels, down to census blocks, since 1970. Highlights of additional summary tables include County Business Patterns data (annual, 1970-2002), agricultural census data (1840-1950), religious bodies data (1850-1952), manufacturing census data (1840-1940), and 2010 census data for SABINS school attendance areas. NHGIS also includes time series tables that provide comparable statistics from multiple censuses linked together with standardized categories and codes for all years. NHGIS data are available through an online access system and are available free of charge to registered users at http://nhgis.org.},
